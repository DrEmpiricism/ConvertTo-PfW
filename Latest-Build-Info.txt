## 2.4 ##

Switched from ImageX to Wimlib for ths script version.

Like ImageX, if the script does not detect the two required files from this repository, it will automatically download them.

The executable version requires no files, as it accesses the WIM file using a C# .NET Framework method using the Wimgapi.dll;  
however, there is no difference in the final image.
