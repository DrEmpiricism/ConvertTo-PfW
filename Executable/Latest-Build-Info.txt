## 2.0.0.6 ##

- There is now a input box that dispays after the conversion process is complete that allows one to select whether the new image is to be saved as a WIM file, using maximum compression, or as an ESD file utilizing solid compression.
- Currently the input box has a timeout of 15 seconds, and if no selection has been made, it will automatically export and compress the new image as a WIM file using maximum compression.
- Selecting "Solid" will compress the image into an ESD file, and this compression process can take quite a while to complete and is system intensive. Do not enable this compression if you're impatient, or if you have a rather outdated PC.
- Optimized the C# code for accessing the WIM handle and added the setting of ("/IMAGE/DISPLAYNAME").Value and ("/IMAGE/DISPLAYDESCRIPTION").Value
- Likewise, a small XML file is exported one can view.
- Changed the XML callback method in closing the image's handle upon completion.
